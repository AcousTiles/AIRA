AIRA (Ambisonics Impulse Response Analyzer) is a novel software for visualizing impulse responses measured from Ambisonics microphones. Its innovative and interactive ui allows you to examine the reflections at a point with a hedgehog-type graph. It is also possible to export the graphs and print them on a floor plan of the analyzed room.

Here are some previews:
